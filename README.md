The Haptic Hang Drum is an experimental instrument made with motorised sliders, servo motors and hall effects sensor.
The motorised sliders simulate a pump that controls the pressure in the firing mechanism. The motorised sliders simulate the pressure mounting in the spring. When the pressure breaks, the ping pong ball is fired and it strikes one of eight hall effect sensors in the hang drum. This triggers a hang drum note sample from Ableton Live.
